You have to make your server or linux safer,u might find such log text like below:
There were xx times failed login until the last successful login
That is because many people use scripts to scan computer's port,some for learning to hack,some for hacking
your computer for money and etc.(what's worst,because of the lack of safety consciousness,many people set
 their account name as root,and password like 'admin',123456`````,or the listening port always is 22)Sound 
 like a family put their valuables on the front door and hope no one will stole it.
 
 - So we should change our login account and some settings
 
    adduser xxx
    passwd xxx
    setpassword xxxxxx
 - But the account still have no root right(i mean the root of system)

    cd home
    ls -al (look all users' privilege)
    vim /etc/pam.d/sshd 
    (add 'auth requied pam_listfile.so item=user sense=allow file=/etc/sshuser onerr=fail)
    vim /etc/sudoers (this need root's privilege)
    (find #Allow root)
    (add 'xxx ALl=(ALL) ALL)
    (and its' below configure should delete the annotation '#')
    vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
    (add 'AllowUsers xxx' and prohibit the root login,and set the max login sessions to 2 or 1)

 - test your network how fast
   ` wget http://cachefly.chachefly.net/100mb.test `

 - snapshot your cpuinfo
   ` cat /proc/cpuinfo/`

- check the log file in order to prevent your machine
```
    cd /var/log/
        -->xferlog (ftp logs)
        -->access-log (HTTP/WEB)
        -->utmp  (current)
    (check who login your machine)
 ```
